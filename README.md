This project maintains the client package for Aardwolf MUD ( http://www.aardwolf.com ) based on the free MUSHclient software ( http://www.mushclient.com/scripts/forum.php ) with plugins and other files customized for Aardwolf. 

Until we migrate the old wiki over to GitHub, documentation currently lives at https://code.google.com/p/aardwolfclientpackage/wiki/Introduction


<hr>

MUSHclient source code is available at https://github.com/nickgammon/mushclient
